# Project Description
The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques, particularly neural networks, to classify billionaires into various categories. This classification is not just based on their wealth, but also on the industry sectors they dominate and whether their fortunes are self-made or inherited. Such an analysis can provide insightful trends and patterns among the world's wealthiest individuals.

# Classifications
Wealth Category Classification: This involves categorizing billionaires into different wealth brackets. It's a nuanced look at how wealth is distributed among the top echelons of society.
Industry Classification: This classification sorts billionaires based on the primary industries of their businesses, offering insights into which sectors are the most lucrative or have the most billionaires.
Self-Made vs. Inherited Wealth: This aspect of the project looks at the origins of wealth, distinguishing between self-made billionaires and those who inherited their fortunes.
Technical Overview
The project is structured as follows:

# Dataset Preprocessing: 
The initial step involves preparing the dataset for analysis. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.
Baseline Classifier Implementation: Before diving into neural networks, the project implements Nearest Neighbor Classifiers as a baseline for comparison.
# Neural Network Model Implementation: 
The core of the project is the development and iterative refinement of neural network models. These models are tuned for optimal performance in the multi-class classification tasks.
Evaluation and Comparison: The project concludes with a thorough evaluation of the models' performance, comparing the results of the neural network models with the baseline classifiers.
# Technologies
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.
TensorFlow and Keras: For building and training neural network models.
Scikit-learn: Used for preprocessing data and implementing baseline classifiers.
Pandas and NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For visualizing data and results.
